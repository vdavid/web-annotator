# WebAnnotator

A social layer for the web that lets you rate articles and read community reviews directly in your browser.

## Overview

Annotator is a Chrome extension that acts like an IMDb for journalism. It allows users to rate articles (1-10 stars), write summaries or reviews, and instantly see the community consensus via a browser badge.

Unlike generic commenting systems, Annotator is strictly focused on **articles**. It uses a smart heuristic to detect if a page is a news article or blog post, disabling itself on search engines, homepages, and web apps to maintain high-quality data. It creates a unified "canonical" URL for every page, ensuring that nytimes.com/article?utm_source=twitter and nytimes.com/article share the same rating history.
